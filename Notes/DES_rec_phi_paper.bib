	Abstract = {One of the primary scientific targets of current and future CMB polarization experiments is the search for a stochastic background of gravity waves in the early universe. As instrumental sensitivity improves, the limiting factor will eventually be B-mode power generated by gravitational lensing, which can be removed through use of so-called ``delensing'' algorithms. We forecast prospects for delensing using lensing maps which are obtained externally to CMB polarization: either from large-scale structure observations, or from high-resolution maps of CMB temperature. We conclude that the forecasts in either case are not encouraging, and that significantly delensing large-scale CMB polarization requires high-resolution polarization maps with sufficient sensitivity to measure the lensing B-mode. We also present a simple formalism for including delensing in CMB forecasts which is computationally fast and agrees well with Monte Carlos.},

@article{sherwin:2015,
	Abstract = {As confusion with lensing B-modes begins to limit experiments that search for primordial B-mode polarization, robust methods for delensing the CMB polarization sky are becoming increasingly important. We investigate in detail the possibility of delensing the CMB with the cosmic infrared background (CIB), emission from dusty star-forming galaxies that is an excellent tracer of the CMB lensing signal, in order to improve constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We find that the maps of the CIB, such as current Planck satellite maps at 545 GHz, can be used to remove more than half of the lensing B-mode power. Calculating optimal combinations of different large-scale-structure tracers for delensing, we find that co-adding CIB data and external arcminute-resolution CMB lensing reconstruction can lead to significant additional improvements in delensing performance. We investigate whether measurement uncertainty in the CIB spectra will degrade the delensing performance if no model of the CIB spectra is assumed, and instead the CIB spectra are marginalized over, when constraining $r$. We find that such uncertainty does not significantly affect B-mode surveys smaller than a few thousand degrees. Even for larger surveys it causes only a moderate reduction in CIB delensing performance, especially if the surveys have high (arcminute) resolution, which allows self-calibration of the delensing procedure. Though further work on the impact of foreground residuals is required, our overall conclusions for delensing with current CIB data are optimistic: this delensing method can tighten constraints on $r$ by a factor up to $\approx2.2$, and by a factor up to $\approx4$ when combined with external $\approx 3 \mu$K-arcmin lensing reconstruction, without requiring the modeling of CIB properties. CIB delensing is thus a promising method for the upcoming generation of CMB polarization surveys.},

	Abstract = {We present new measurements of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies using Planck. Combining HFI data with IRAS, the angular auto- and cross-frequency power spectrum is measured from 143 to 3000 GHz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 GHz. The total areas used to compute the CIB power spectrum and bispectrum are about 2240 and 4400 deg2, respectively. After careful removal of the contaminants (cosmic microwave background anisotropies, Galactic dust, and Sunyaev-Zeldovich emission), and a complete study of systematics, the CIB power spectrum is measured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipoles l ~ 150 to 2500. The bispectrum due to the clustering of dusty, star-forming galaxies is measured from l ~ 130 to 1100, with a total signal to noise ratio of around 6, 19, and 29 at 217, 353, and 545 GHz, respectively. Two approaches are developed for modelling CIB power spectrum anisotropies. The first approach takes advantage of the unique measurements by Planck at large angular scales, and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of dark matter haloes hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by their contribution to the emissivities. The second approach is based on a model that associates star-forming galaxies with dark matter haloes and their subhaloes, using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosity and (sub-)halo mass. The two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. We find that the star formation history is well constrained up to redshifts around 2, and agrees with recent estimates of the obscured star-formation density using Spitzer and Herschel. However, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the star formation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in the spectral energy distribution of CIB galaxies. We also find that the mean halo mass which is most efficient at hosting star formation is log (Meff/M&sun;) = 12.6 and that CIB galaxies have warmer temperatures as redshift increases. The CIB bispectrum is steeper than that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a power law; this gives some information about the contribution of massive haloes to the CIB bispectrum. Finally, we show that the same halo occupation distribution can fit all power spectra simultaneously. The precise measurements enabled by Planck pose new challenges for the modelling of CIB anisotropies, indicating the power of using CIB anisotropies to understand the process of galaxy formation.},

@article{planck-collaboration:2014,
	Abstract = {The multi-frequency capability of the Planck satellite provides information both on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infrared background, or CIB) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensing effect on the cosmic microwave background, or CMB). The conjunction of these two unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark and luminous matter in the high redshift (1 <= z <= 3) Universe. We use a three-point statistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143, and 217 GHz, together with CIB measurements at 100-857 GHz. Following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite of consistency tests, we report the first detection of the correlation between the CIB and CMB lensing. The well matched redshift distribution of these two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42/19sigma (statistical/statistical + systematics) at 545 GHz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers. Our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both CIB auto- and CIB-lensing cross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with a characteristic mass scale for the halos hosting CIB sources of log10(M/M&sun;) = 10.5 $\pm$ 0.6. Leveraging the frequency dependence of our signal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the CIB, and constrain the star formation rate (SFR) density at z >= 1. We measure directly the SFR density with around 2sigma significance for three redshift bins between z = 1 and 7, thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at early times.},

	Abstract = {We use data from the first 100 deg2 field observed by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) in 2008 to measure the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies contributed by the background of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at millimeter wavelengths. From the auto- and cross-correlation of 150 and 220 GHz SPT maps, we significantly detect both Poisson distributed and, for the first time at millimeter wavelengths, clustered components of power from a background of DSFGs. The spectral indices of the Poisson and clustered components are found to be \bar{alpha}_{150-220}^P=3.86$\pm$ 0.23 and alpha C  150-220 = 3.8 $\pm$ 1.3, implying a steep scaling of the dust emissivity index beta ~ 2. The Poisson and clustered power detected in SPT, BLAST (at 600, 860, and 1200 GHz), and Spitzer (1900 GHz) data can be understood in the context of a simple model in which all galaxies have the same graybody spectrum with dust emissivity index of beta = 2 and dust temperature Td = 34 K. In this model, half of the 150 GHz background light comes from redshifts greater than 3.2. We also use the SPT data to place an upper limit on the amplitude of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum at ell = 3000 of 13 muK2 at 95% confidence.},

@article{ade:2014,
	Abstract = {We report results from the BICEP2 experiment, a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimeter specifically designed to search for the signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around l˜80. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of ≈300 muKCMB&surd;s . BICEP2 observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nK deg in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations, and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-LambdaCDM expectation in the range 30<l<150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of >5sigma. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. Cross correlating against WMAP 23 GHz maps we find that Galactic synchrotron makes a negligible contribution to the observed signal. We also examine a number of available models of polarized dust emission and find that at their default parameter values they predict power ˜(5-10)× smaller than the observed excess signal (with no significant cross-correlation with our maps). However, these models are not sufficiently constrained by external public data to exclude the possibility of dust emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal. Cross correlating BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with 3sigma significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the CMB, disfavoring dust at 1.7sigma. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well fit by a lensed-LambdaCDM+tensor theoretical model with tensor-to-scalar ratio r =0.20-0.05+0.07, with r=0 disfavored at 7.0sigma. Accounting for the contribution of foreground, dust will shift this value downward by an amount which will be better constrained with upcoming data sets.},

	Abstract = {We have correlated the far-infrared emission from dust as measured by the DIRBE and FIRAS experiments with the 21-cm emission from gas as measured by the Leiden/Dwingeloo survey of HI in our Galaxy. A tight correlation is observed at high |b| at wavelengths ranging from 100mum to 1mm. The dust emission spectrum derived from the correlation is fit well by a single Planck curve characterized by T=17.5K and an emissivity proportional to nu^2^. The dust emissivity tau/N_H_=1.0x10^-25^ (lambda/250mum)^-2^cm^2^ is remarkably close to the value in the Draine and Lee (1984) dust model and is much smaller than values predicted for porous or fractal grains. In the emission from HI gas, we exclude the presence of a very cold dust component with comparable emissivity, unless its temperature is significantly smaller than 7K. We also discuss the contribution from Galactic molecular and ionized gas to the global IR emission.},

	Abstract = {We present all-sky dust modelling of the high resolution Planck, IRAS and WISE infrared (IR) observations using the physical dust model presented by Draine & Li in 2007 (DL). We study the performance of this model and present implications for future dust modelling. The present work extends to the full sky the dust modelling carried out on nearby galaxies using Herschel and Spitzer data. We employ the DL dust model to generate maps of the dust mass surface density, the dust optical extinction AV, and the starlight intensity heating the bulk of the dust, parametrized by Umin. We test the model by comparing these maps with independent estimates of the dust optical extinction AV . In molecular clouds, we compare the DL AV estimates with maps generated from stellar optical observations from the 2MASS survey. The DL AV estimates are a factor of about 3 larger than values estimated from 2MASS observations. In the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) we compare the DL optical extinction AV estimates with optical estimates from approximately 200,000 QSOs observed in the Sloan digital sky survey. The DL AV estimates are larger than those determined from the QSOs, and this discrepancy depends on Umin. We propose an empirical renormalization of the DL AV estimate, dependent of Umin, which compensates for the systematic differences found here. This renormalization, bringing into agreement the AV estimates on QSOs, also brings into agreement the AV estimates on molecular clouds. In the diffuse ISM, the DL fitting parameter Umin, appears to trace variations in the far-IR opacity of the dust grains. Therefore, some of the physical assumptions of the DL model need to be revised. We provide a family of SEDs normalized by optical reddening, parameterized by Umin; these will be the constraints for a next generation of dust models.},

@article{planck-collaboration:2011,
	Abstract = {Using Planck maps of six regions of low Galactic dust emission with a total area of about 140 deg2, we determine the angular power spectra of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l = 2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 GHz. We use 21-cm observations of Hi as a tracer of thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of Galactic dust emission and use the 143 GHz Planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmic microwave background anisotropies. Both of these cleaning processes are necessary to avoid significant contamination of the CIB signal. We measure correlated CIB structure across frequencies. As expected, the correlation decreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution of high-redshift galaxies to CIB anisotropies increases with wavelengths. We find no significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the CIB anisotropies and the CIB mean, with DeltaI / I = 15% from 217 to 857 GHz. In terms of clustering properties, the Planck data alone rule out the linear scale- and redshift-independent bias model. Non-linear corrections are significant. Consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy, parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. It provides an excellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggests that a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency, which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated by contributions from different redshifts. In our best-fit model, half of the anisotropy power at l = 2000 comes from redshifts z < 0.8 at 857 GHz and z < 1.5 at 545 GHz, while about 90% come from redshifts z > 2 at 353 and 217 GHz, respectively.

	Abstract = {Szapudi et al (2001) introduced the method of estimating angular power spectrum of the CMB sky via heuristically weighted correlation functions. Part of the new technique is that all (co)variances are evaluated by massive Monte Carlo simulations, therefore a fast way to measure correlation functions in a high resolution map is essential. This letter presents a new algorithm to calculate pixel space correlation functions via fast spherical harmonics transforms. Our present implementation of the idea extracts correlations from a MAP-like CMB map (HEALPix resolution of 512, i.e. $ \simeq 3 \times 10^6$ pixels) in about 5 minutes on a 500MHz computer, including $C_\ell$ inversion; the analysis of one Planck-like map takes less then one hour. We use heuristic window and noise weighting in pixel space, and include the possibility of additional signal weighting as well, either in $\ell$ or pixel space. We apply the new code to an ensemble of MAP simulations, to test the response of our method to the inhomogenous sky coverage/noise of MAP. We show that the resulting $C_\ell$'s are very close to the theoretical expectations. The HEALPix based implementation of the method, SpICE (Spatially Inhomogenous Correlation Estimator) will be available to the public from the authors.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background generates a curl pattern in the observed polarization. This ``B-mode'' signal provides a measure of the projected mass distribution over the entire observable Universe and also acts as a contaminant for the measurement of primordial gravity-wave signals. In this Letter we present the first detection of gravitational lensing B modes, using first-season data from the polarization-sensitive receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPTpol). We construct a template for the lensing B-mode signal by combining E-mode polarization measured by SPTpol with estimates of the lensing potential from a Herschel-SPIRE map of the cosmic infrared background. We compare this template to the B modes measured directly by SPTpol, finding a nonzero correlation at 7.7sigma significance. The correlation has an amplitude and scale dependence consistent with theoretical expectations, is robust with respect to analysis choices, and constitutes the first measurement of a powerful cosmological observable.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing has several important
                   effects on the cosmic microwave background (CMB): it
                   changes the CMB power spectra, induces
                   non-Gaussianities, and generates a B-mode
                   polarization signal that is an important source of
                   confusion for the signal from primordial
                   gravitational waves. The lensing signal can also be
                   used to help constrain cosmological parameters and
                   lensing mass distributions. We review the origin and
                   calculation of these effects. Topics include: lensing
                   in General Relativity, the lensing potential, lensed
                   temperature and polarization power spectra,
                   implications for constraining inflation, non-Gaussian
                   structure, reconstruction of the lensing potential,
                   delensing, sky curvature corrections, simulations,
                   cosmological parameter estimation, cluster mass
                   reconstruction, and moving lenses/dipole lensing.},
